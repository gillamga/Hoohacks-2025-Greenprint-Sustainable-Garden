## Mission Statement
Commercial agriculture is often cited as one fo the industries with the highest carbon footprints in America; given this, environmentally conscious individuals may often wish to turn homegrown produce as an eco-friendly alternative. Unfortunately, studies have found that for the common urban gardener, cabron footprints can massively exceed those of commericial crop farms. From a 2024 study on urban v. commercial agriculture: *"results reveal that the carbon footprint of food from [urban agriculture] is six times greater than conventional agriculture (420 gCO2e versus 70 gCO2e per serving). However, some [urban agriculture] crops (for example, tomatoes) and sites (for example, 25% of individually managed gardens) outperform conventional agriculture."*^1 

(talk about why this is the case)

(tak about how we can improve home garden sustainability - why shedding reliance on commercial agriculture is so important, transportation footprints, etc.)
